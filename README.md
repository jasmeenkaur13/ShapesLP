# ShapesLP
Processing text to draw shapes

## Areas Of Improvement
1. Use Of XMLHTTPRequest.Could have chosen more better platform for the same eg. Angular.
2. Client Side Validations are not in Place.
3. Square should have one side and rectangle two etc type validations can be implemented.
4. Logging can be added.
5. Router could have been implemented with the help of a middle tier application, so that Routes can also be used as decorator for the functions.
